# Artemis-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individual financial plans. They needed to protect their system from external threats and modernize their software.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I efficiently identified the security vulnerabilities and recognized false positives. It is important to code securely because poor code can introduce vulnerabilities. Secure software provides a lot of value to a company's well-being because it reduces the likelihood of a compromise, thus safeguarding client data.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment guide was helpful.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security layers by implementing an HTTPS system and using certificates. In the future, I would use the Maven Dependency Check to identify vulnerabilities in the system and determine mitigation techniques based on the required level of software security.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure code functionality and security, I deployed the code and tested it without certificates. After refactoring, I utilized the Maven Dependency Check to identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the Maven Dependency Check, the keystore for certificate creation, and HTTPS practices. These skills will be valuable in future projects.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I will demonstrate my ability to successfully identify vulnerabilities and create mitigation plans to resolve them, as well as how to enhance software security..
